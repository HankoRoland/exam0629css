      <h4>Emergence of scaling in random networks</h4>
      <p>A.-L. Barabási, R. Albert / Science 286, 509-512 (1999)</p>
      <p>Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the world wide web are best described as
        networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the
        vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be
        a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the
        addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected
        sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scalefree distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust
        self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.</p>

      <h4>Statical mechanics of complex networks</h4>
      <p>A.-L. Barabási, R. Albert / Reviews of Modern Physics 74, 47-97 (2002)</p>
      <p>Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples
        include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of
        routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been
        modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real
        networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the
        field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics.
        After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss
        the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks,
        the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network’s
        robustness against failures and attacks.</p>
